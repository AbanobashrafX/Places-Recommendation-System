Collaborative filtering is a family of algorithms where there are multiple ways to find similar users or items and multiple ways to calculate rating based on ratings of similar users. Depending on the choices you make, you end up with a type of collaborative filtering approach.

One important thing to keep in mind is that in an approach based purely on collaborative filtering, the similarity is not calculated using factors like the age of users, genre of the movie, or any other data about users or items. It is calculated only on the basis of the rating (explicit or implicit) a user gives to an item. For example, two users can be considered similar if they give the same ratings to ten movies despite there being a big difference in their age.

The third question for how to measure the accuracy of your predictions also has multiple answers, which include error calculation techniques that can be used in many places and not just recommenders based on collaborative filtering.

One of the approaches to measure the accuracy of your result is the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), in which you predict ratings for a test dataset of user-item pairs whose rating values are already known. The difference between the known value and the predicted value would be the error. Square all the error values for the test set, find the average (or mean), and then take the square root of that average to get the RMSE.

Another metric to measure the accuracy is Mean Absolute Error (MAE), in which you find the magnitude of error by finding its absolute value and then taking the average of all error values.

You don’t need to worry about the details of RMSE or MAE at this point as they are readily available as part of various packages in Python, and you will see them later in the article.

Now let’s look at the different types of algorithms in the family of collaborative filtering.
